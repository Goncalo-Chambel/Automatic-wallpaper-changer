# Automatic-wallpaper-changer
This application will update your windows wallpaper automatically everyday, by fetching images from google using your search terms

# Instructions

* Clone this repository or just download it as a .zip
* 
* Inside the "Files" folder, double click on the "setupTask.exe" file to create a new automatic task. By default the update hour is 10:00 am. If you want to change that go the "create_task.ps1" file and change the hour. Don't forget to delete the current task in the Task Scheduler if you had already created one
* 
* On the main folder double click on the "WallpaperChanger.exe". This will open a window asking if you want to download new images. 
** You can search for multiple terms at once, just separate them by a comma
** You can also filter the images by applying the filters bellow. Keep in mind that the more filters you add, the less images the program is going to find
** Once the images are downloaded (it could take a few minutes depending on the search terms), you can visualize them to delete any you don't like
** You can also use this program to instantly chnage the current wallpaper.
