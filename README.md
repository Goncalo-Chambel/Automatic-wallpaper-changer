# Automatic-wallpaper-changer
This application will update your windows wallpaper automatically everyday, by fetching images from google using your search terms

# Instructions

1. Clone this repository or just download it as a .zip
2. Inside the "Files" folder, double click on the "setupTask.exe" file to create a new automatic task. By default the update hour is 10:00 am. If you want to change that go the "create_task.ps1" file and change the hour. Don't forget to delete the current task in the Task Scheduler if you had already created one
3. On the main folder double click on the "WallpaperChanger.exe". This will open a window asking if you want to download new images. 
** You can search for multiple terms at once, just separate them by a comma
  b. You can also filter the images by applying the filters bellow. Keep in mind that the more filters you add, the less images the program is going to find
  c. Once the images are downloaded (it could take a few minutes depending on the search terms), you can visualize them to delete any you don't like
  d. You can also use this program to instantly chnage the current wallpaper.
